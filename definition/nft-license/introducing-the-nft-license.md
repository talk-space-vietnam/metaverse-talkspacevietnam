# Introducing the NFT License

The NFT License helps define the rights of both owners of ERC-721 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as well as artists and creators working with NFTs. The NFT License is designed to balance two concerns:

* Protecting the hard work and ingenuity of creators
* Granting users the freedom and flexibility to fully enjoy their non-fungible tokens

Any NFT project can use this license.

**What am I allowed to do with the art associated with my NFT?**

You have broad rights to use the art associated with your NFT. In the case of CryptoKitties, you can do any of the following:

* Use the Kitty art for your own personal, non-commercial use;
* Use the Kitty art when you’re on a marketplace that allows the purchase and sale of your Kitty, so long as the marketplace cryptographically verifies that you are the owner;
* Use the Kitty art when you’re on a third party website or app that allows the inclusion, involvement, or participation of your Kitty, so long as the website/app cryptographically verifies that you are the owner, and the Kitty art doesn’t stay on the website/app after you’ve left; and
* Use the Kitty art to commercialize your own merchandise, provided that you aren’t earning more than $100,000 in revenue each year from doing so.

**What am I NOT allowed to do with the art associated with my NFT?**

There are a few things that aren’t appropriate uses for your NFT art. They include:

* Modifying the art;
* Using the art to market or sell third-party products;
* Using the art in connection with images of hatred, violence, or other inappropriate behavior; or
* Trying to trademark your art, or otherwise acquire intellectual property rights in it.

#### Why does the NFT License matter?

Artists and creators traditionally have had two options:

* Open source their work and relinquish all rights to it
* Copyright their work, locking down their rights but severely restricting its reach

The NFT License offers a more practical middle ground. We hope the NFT License provides a framework for blockchain developers to establish sustainable businesses and offer them a secure path to monetization, much like the App Store did for early third-party developers.

We don’t know exactly what the future looks like, but we know everyone should have a say in it. The NFT License is a first step in determining what it will mean to own digital assets in the years ahead. We hope it will help spark new ideas, new businesses, and new ways of thinking.

The NFT License is a collaborative work in progress. [We’re eager for feedback on improving it.](mailto:feedback@niftylicense.org)
